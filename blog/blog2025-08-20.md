Job hunting in tech can feel like running through a maze blindfolded—dead ends, wrong turns, and that sinking feeling when you realize you’ve forgotten which companies you’ve applied to. For software QA roles in South Africa, this chaos was my reality, until I built a workflow that turned the mess into **a lean, mean, application-tracking machine**.

It all started with clarity. I knew exactly what I was looking for: QA Engineers, QA Automation Engineers, Test Analysts, and Quality Engineers. I was explicit—no contact center QA roles, no SDETs masquerading as “QA.” This wasn’t just picky; it was strategic. I wanted software quality, not customer service call logs.

With the target defined, the next challenge was hunting the listings themselves. Scrolling through Indeed, PNet, LinkedIn, and company career pages, I pulled **active, verified job postings**. Every role captured: the company, the city (or remote status), sector, salary if available, contact person, and, most importantly, the direct application link. No duplicates. No fluff. Each entry had to earn its place on the list.

Now came the part where most people stumble: **organizing all this into something usable**. Enter Notion. I wanted a tracker where I could see my progress at a glance: Priority, Position, Company, Location, Salary, Sector, Contact, Link, Stage, Notes. Sounds simple, but Notion is picky. A single extra comma, a missing column, or a misformatted URL, and the import fails.

To avoid this nightmare, I crafted a **CSV file ready for Notion**. Every field containing commas—like “Cape Town, Western Cape”—was enclosed in quotes. Every row had exactly ten columns. No duplicates, no missing data, and the “Stage” column proudly declared “Application Pending.” Thirty unique jobs, ready to track and conquer.

Importing into Notion felt like lifting a curse. At first, the preview showed only five jobs, a tease for what was to come. But when the import completed, all thirty appeared—lined up neatly, ready to be sorted, filtered, and moved through the stages of my hunt: Application Pending → Applied → Interview → Offer. Notes were added, reminders set, all my follow-ups suddenly in one clean, manageable place.

This workflow didn’t just save time; it gave me **control**, confidence, and a real sense of momentum. Each role felt tangible, actionable, and within reach. And the beauty of it? It’s infinitely scalable. New job listings can be added weekly. Automation is possible with Notion’s API, or even Zapier integrations, turning alerts straight into database entries.

What started as a chaotic, stressful job hunt became **an organized, high-powered system**. And the best part? I could focus on what matters most—preparing for interviews, refining my skills, and moving deliberately toward my next QA role.

If you’re hunting for software QA positions, consider this approach. Define your roles, gather verified postings, prepare them for Notion, and track your applications like a pro. Chaos becomes clarity. Frustration becomes forward motion. And the job hunt? It becomes something you control, not something that controls you.
